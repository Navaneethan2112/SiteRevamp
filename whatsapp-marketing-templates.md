## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with 2-3 templates** - Don't submit all at once
2. **Test variables carefully** - Make sure they make sense in context
3. **Follow the character limit** - WhatsApp is strict about length
4. **Be specific about benefits** - Vague promises get rejected
5. **Include clear call-to-action** - Tell users what to do next
